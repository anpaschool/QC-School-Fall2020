# QC-School-Fall2020

The Association of Nepali Physicists in America (ANPA) is a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to furthering physical science education and sharing physics research among Nepali physicists around the globe through various scientific activities.

ANPA was established in 2018 by a group of Nepali Physicists in the USA.


ANPA will primarily serve:


To advance research in physical sciences in Nepal as well as among Nepalese Physicists in the USA.
To provide a forum for Nepali physicists around the globe, especially in the USA, to exchange pedagogy of physics education and technical expertise that influence the teaching of Physical Sciences.
To provide a forum to enhance science and technology in Nepal through various programs including but not limited to educational programs in school, college and university levels, and scientific seminars/conferences.

We host various discussion forums and informal classes throughout the year. Some of those classes include honing programming skills, exploring the world of Quantum Computing, and Data Science.

This Fall we will be offering Quantum Computing classes with a focus on Quantum Machine Learning.

This repository will include all the Jupyter Notebooks discussed in our classes and discussions in QC School Fall2020. 

Notebook will be added after every class.
